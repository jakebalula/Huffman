In computer science and information theory, Huffman coding is an algorithm used for lossless data compression. 
The idea is to assign variable-length codes to input characters, with shorter codes assigned to more frequent characters.

Huffman coding is based on the frequency of occurrence of a data item.

The method was developed by David A. Huffman while he was a Sc.D. student at MIT, and was published in the 1952 paper “A Method for the Construction of Minimum-Redundancy Codes.”

In practice, Huffman coding is widely used in applications such as file compression formats (like ZIP and GZIP), image formats (like JPEG), and network protocols (such as HTTP/2).

The algorithm constructs a binary tree of nodes, where each leaf node corresponds to a symbol from the input data and its frequency of occurrence.

The two nodes with the lowest frequency are combined to form a new node, whose frequency is the sum of the two.

This process repeats until only one node remains — the root of the Huffman tree.

By traversing the Huffman tree from root to leaves, each symbol is assigned a unique binary code.

This property guarantees that no code is a prefix of another, making the set of codes prefix-free.

The encoded data can thus be unambiguously decoded by following the binary tree structure.

Huffman coding achieves optimal compression for a given set of symbol frequencies under the assumption of independent symbols.

To test Huffman coding implementations, it is important to use a dataset that includes both frequent and rare characters, numbers, punctuation marks, and varying amounts of whitespace.

This ensures that the Huffman tree contains both shallow and deep branches, testing your code’s recursive traversal and prefix handling.

The effectiveness of the algorithm can be measured by comparing the number of bits required before and after encoding, calculating the compression ratio.

For instance, if your original text file is 12,000 bytes (96,000 bits) and the Huffman-encoded version uses 38,000 bits, then the compression ratio is approximately 2.53:1.

In real-world systems, Huffman coding is often combined with other methods such as run-length encoding or arithmetic coding for even higher compression efficiency.
